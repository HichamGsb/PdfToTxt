Summary Evaluation with and without References 

______________________________
Abstract—We study a new content-based method for
the evaluation of text summarization systems without
human models which is used to produce system rankings.
The research is carried out using a new content-based
evaluation framework called F RESA to compute a variety of
divergences among probability distributions. We apply our
comparison framework to various well-established content-based
evaluation measures in text summarization such as C OVERAGE,
R ESPONSIVENESS, P YRAMIDS and ROUGE studying their
associations in various text summarization tasks including
generic multi-document summarization in English and French,
focus-based multi-document summarization in English and
generic single-document summarization in French and Spanish.
Index Terms—Text summarization evaluation, content-based
evaluation measures, divergences.
