Hybrid Headlines: Combining Topics and Sentence Compression 

______________________________
This paper presents Topiary, a headline-
generation system that creates very
short, informative summaries for news
stories by combining sentence compres-
sion and unsupervised topic discovery.
We will show that the combination of
linguistically motivated sentence com-
pression with statistically selected topic
terms performs better than either alone,
according to some automatic summary
evaluation measures. In addition we de-
scribe experimental results establishing
an appropriate extrinsic task on which to
measure the effect of summarization on
human performance. We demonstrate
the usefulness of headlines in compar-
ison to full texts in the context of this
extrinsic task.
