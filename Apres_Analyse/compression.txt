Multi-Candidate Reduction: Sentence Compression as a Tool for Document Summarization Tasks∗ 

______________________________
This article examines the application of two single-document sentence compression techniques
to the problem of multi-document summarization—a “parse-and-trim” approach and a statisti-
cal noisy-channel approach. We introduce the Multi-Candidate Reduction (MCR) framework for
multi-document summarization, in which many compressed candidates are generated for each source
sentence. These candidates are then selected for inclusion in the final summary based on a com-
bination of static and dynamic features. Evaluations demonstrate that sentence compression is a
valuable component of a larger multi-document summarization framework.
