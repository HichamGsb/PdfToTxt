Statistics-Based Summarization — Step One: Sentence Compression 

______________________________
Abstract
When humans produce summaries of documents, they
do not simply extract sentences and concatenate them.
Rather, they create new sentences that are grammatical, that cohere with one another, and that capture the
most salient pieces of information in the original document. Given that large collections of text/abstract
pairs are available online, it is now possible to envision
algorithms that are trained to mimic this process. In
this paper, we focus on sentence compression, a simpler version of this larger challenge. We aim to achieve
two goals simultaneously: our compressions should be
grammatical, and they should retain the most important pieces of information. These two goals can conﬂict. We devise both noisy-channel and decision-tree
approaches to the problem, and we evaluate results
against manual compressions and a simple baseline.
