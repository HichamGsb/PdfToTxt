Abstract
This paper presents Topiary, a headlinegeneration system that creates very short, informative summaries for news stories by combining sentence compression and unsupervised topic discovery. We will show that the combination of linguistically motivated sentence compression with statistically selected topic terms performs better than either alone, according to some automatic summary evaluation measures. In addition we describe experimental results establishing an appropriate extrinsic task on which to measure the effect of summarization on human performance. We demonstrate the usefulness of headlines in comparison to full texts in the context of this extrinsic task.

In this paper we present Topiary, a headlinegeneration system that creates very short, informative summaries for news stories by combining sentence compression and unsupervised topic discovery. Hedge Trimmer performs sentence compression by removing constituents from a parse tree of the lead sentence according to a set of linguistically-motivated heuristics until a length threshold is reached. Unsupervised Topic Discovery is a statistical method for deriving a set of topic models from a document corpus, assigning meaningful names to the topic models, and associating

sets of topics with specific documents. The topics and sentence compressions are combined in a manner that preserves the advantages of each approach: the fluency and event-oriented information from the lead sentence with the broader coverage of the topic models.
The next section presents previous work in the area of automatic summarization. Following this we describe Hedge Trimmer and Unsupervised Topic Discovery in more detail, and describe the algorithm for combining sentence compression with topics. Next we show that Topiary scores higher than either Hedge Trimmer or Unsupervised Topic Discovery alone according to certain automatic evaluation tools for summarization. Finally we propose event tracking as an extrinsic task using automatic summarization for measuring how human performance is affected by automatic summarization, and for correlating human peformance with automatic evaluation tools. We describe an experiment that supports event tracking as an appropriate task for this purpose, and show results that suggest that a well-written human headline is nearly as useful for event tracking as the full text.
