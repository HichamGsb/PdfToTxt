<abstract>
Sentence compression holds promise for many applications ranging from summarization
to subtitle generation. Our work views sentence compression as an optimization problem
and uses integer linear programming (ILP) to infer globally optimal compressions in the
presence of linguistically motivated constraints. We show how previous formulations of
sentence compression can be recast as ILPs and extend these models with novel global
constraints. Experimental results on written and spoken texts demonstrate improvements
over state-of-the-art models.
